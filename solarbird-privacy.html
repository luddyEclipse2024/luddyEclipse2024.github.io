    Names are not required information; by supplying your name and providing valid bird behavior observations, you opt in to be acknowledged in a forthcoming scientific publication. They are securely stored and will never be shared with third parties or used for any other purposes beyond acknowledgement of your contributions. 
    IP addresses are securely stored for internal use in data validation and quality control; they are not shared publicly in any form, including in scientific datasets or publications. 
    GPS coordinates and observation times are securely stored for internal use in scientific data analysis (including but not limited to correlating observations with eclipse phase, temperature, cloud coverage, barometric pressure, and other non-identifying variables of scientific interest). GPS coordinates will never be shared with third parties or used for other purposes. 
    Bird observations are not personally identifying, and will be shared as open data and in scientific publications.

    <h1 class="head">SolarBird: Community Bird Science</h1>
    <h3>Look to the Sky: Investigating how birds respond to a solar eclipse through community science</h3>
    <h5>This April, we are going to experience an incredible phenomenon that will unlock a rare opportunity to study the natural world. The solar eclipse is going to align with the peak of bird migration and establishment of territories. Given how limited and often anecdotal data on animal behavior during an eclipse can be, this combination of events lays the foundation for deeply exciting research.
        
        With the development of SolarBird, a community science app, we hope to encourage the public to connect with nature and the scientific process by collecting data on bird behavior throughout the progression of the eclipse.
        
        SolarBird will be accessible for individuals at all levels of expertise, from avid birders to young, budding naturalists, and data collection can happen anywhere â€“ at home, a local park, or by looking through a window.
        
        The app will be free and should be available soon through the App Store and Google Play. More to come!</h5>
