    <h1 class="head">Event Information</h1>
        <h5>Come to the Arboretum on April 8th or watch the livestream from 1-5 pm to see the solar eclipse!</h5>
        <h5>The partial eclipse starts at 1:49 pm; the total eclipse will last from around 3:04-3:09 pm; the partial eclipse will end at 4:23 pm</h5>
        <h5>Luddy has bought plenty of eclipse glasses for people to come to the grounds and watch the eclipse occur as well as see what we are doing in real time.</h5>
        <h5>We will use telescopes with white light and hydrogen alpha filters to caputure images during the partial and total eclipse. 
            These images will be processed in real time on a livestream, and will later be made available on this website.
            Some examples of the capabilities of this image processing taken and edited by Paul are shown below:

        <h5>According to the path NASA has predicted, the eclipse will be in totality directly over Bloomington, Indiana, the home of Indiana University.</h5>
        <h5>Therefore, we found it fitting for a group in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering to get involved.</h5>

    <h1 class="head">More in Bloomington</h1>
        <h5>Since this is such a huge event for Bloomington, other programs associated with Indiana University have programs that would be neat to look at.
            Some of these programs include a balloon with a camera by the engineering department, a Citizen science app to track animal behavior, and informational sessions from the Astronomy department.
        </h5>
        <h5>The Saturday before, April 6th, IU is hosting a Science Fest in Franklin Hall, where the Luddy team will have 2 tables. 
            Find out more about this event at <a class="other" href="https://sciencefest.indiana.edu/">Science Fest at IU</a></h5>
        <h5>The Luddy team is also in correspondence with Liz Aguilar, a biologist in the College who is leading development of a community science app for the eclipse, to observe changes in bird behavior. 
            This app is called SolarBird and should be pushed out soon. More to come! See the page <a class="other" href="solarbird.html">SolarBird</a> for details!</h5>
        <h5>As the date gets closer, more information will be posted here.</h5>

    <h1 class="head">K12 Outreach</h1>
        <h5>Our program is also in coordination with representatives from the Monroe County Community School Corporation (MCCSC).
            Together, we are working on providing an interactive lesson to students at the Academy with a focus on computer science and project-based learning to teach them about the eclipse, our telescopes, and image processing.
            This initiative will not only forge a hopefully annual connection between Luddy and the Academy, but will provide these students with a unique learning experience that introduces that to many aspects of science and art.
        </h5>
        <h5>In addition, the Luddy Scholars will be sending our website and instructional infromation to all staff in the MCCSC so they can encourage their K12 students to watch our livestream safely from home.</h5>
